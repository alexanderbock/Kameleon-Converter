The Kameleon-\/\-Interpolator library is a C++ library that provides classes to access and interpolate from data files produced by multiple space weather products. It currently supports the output from the following products\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open\-G\-G\-C\-M
\item B\-A\-T\-S\-R\-U\-S (Global M\-H\-D) and the B\-A\-T\-S\-R\-U\-S component of S\-W\-M\-F
\item Ionospheric component of S\-W\-M\-F
\item E\-N\-L\-I\-L
\item M\-A\-S
\item C\-T\-I\-P
\item A\-D\-A\-P\-T3\-D
\end{DoxyItemize}

Java, C, and Fortran compatible interfaces are provided through the use of the wrapper headers and code (ccmc/wrappers/$\ast$).\hypertarget{index_Purpose}{}\section{Purpose}\label{index_Purpose}
The purpose of this library is to provide easy access and interpolation methods for multiple space weather simulation model datasets, to provide access to derived variables, and to calculate fieldlines using any of the model vector field variables. Derived variables are those that can be calculated from the base variables provided by the native data files.\hypertarget{index_Examples}{}\section{Example code}\label{index_Examples}
